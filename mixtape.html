        Jay Chou is one of the most famous artists among Asia. His song covers all my 
        high school and college life. I am not sure when this song released, but it 
        reminds me the senior year of my high school. Every high school student in Taiwan
        shares the same memory. We go to cramschool around Taipei Railroad Station 
        three times or four times a week to prepare the coming college entrance exam. 
        We hung out with friends around that area. We went to record stores, stationary 
        stores, and we took those 'photo stickers' a lot. It was one of my best times in 
        life. I was so fearless, energetic, and hopeful. Life is full of possibilities.

        This song belongs my last year of college. I was studying very
        hard for the GRE test and Germany class I took. Spending more than 12 hours
        in the library everyday, I studied alone, ate alone, and listened 
        to music alone. I repeated this song very much in that year. Mostly
        when I was waiting for bus from library to home at late night. I can 
        still smell the cold air in that winter when I listen to this.</br>
        Sentiment kills me tonight.

        This song is from soundtrack of 'Her'. Like the 
        movie, this song is the sweetest and saddest. I can
        never get tired of it. This song has been with me for
        countless sleepless nights.

        I am so in love with the bubbly rhythm, the pinky and bright music video, 
        and the attractive voice. I bumped into this song one night in radio. I 
        wanted to know this song so eager that I pulled over my car and open my
        Shazam.

        I came to the U.S. six years ago. Most of time I feel like an 
        outsider here. One of the reasons I love American pop music is that 
        when I sing these songs, I can pretend I am part of the culture 
        here. Once I pretend hard enough, long enough, it just comes true.

        Met this Korean group half years ago. Feel related because one of their
        members is originally Taiwanese. Love their experimental style of music. 
        Love the creative background sound here.

        I repeated this song for a month in the hottest summer I've ever 
        remember.Since then every time I hear this, I got homesick attack! 
        Taiwan's summer is unbeatable, irreplaceable.</p>
